                  Under this title I will publish articles how established banks should approach their customers in a digital world with a client centric view in mind. I will concentrate here on the view which is generally managed in a bank by a 
                 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management">Customer Relationship Management</a> (CRM) system. Obviously there are other views which are important for a bank, i.e. a client risk exposure- or client profitability view, but all these  others view are out of scope here.<br>
                </div>
                <div>
                 <br>
                </div>
                <div>
                  First of all, a bank is interacting with Persons and nothing more. An Person is a human being who has an real identity (and often multiple digital identities), who got born somewhere on this planet, may have a nationality and is domiciled in a country at a certain point in time.
                </div>
                <div>
                 <br>
                </div>
                <div>
                  As a side remark, this is the normal case unfortunately there a stateless persons which may have no domicile at the moment, which were treated as unbanked persons,
                 <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/globalfindex">as another 2.5 billions persons mainly in poor countries</a>. A topic for another article, which will show the opportunities for digital banks who starting serving this segment. 
                </div>
                <div>
                 <br>
                </div>
                <div>
                  For sure the bank will make businesses with a company or a family office, but finally the bank is  interacting with a person(s) which may representing in a certain
                 <u>role </u>a company, a simple partnership, a trust or family office. 
                </div>

                 <i><b>This is the first important recognition</b>: Persons are the centre of interests which are interacting with us in one or multiple roles. We cannot interact directly with a company or group construct we are always in contact with human beings.</i>
                </div>
                <div>

                <div>
                  I explicitly don’t use the term “customer” here. We as a bank (you could generalize it to any other industry) will have Person relationships which we may be aware of or not and which may finally result in a profitable customer relationship.
                </div>
                <div>
                 <br>
                </div>
                <div>
                 <i><b>The second important recognition</b>: It’s about relationships, being in no relationship with a Person, means he (as well as we) are not aware of each other (non-existent for the moment) and not reachable for any kind of business.</i>
                </div>
                <div>

                  This leads us to the concept of relationship phases, which are used to position persons which are interacting with us.
                </div>
                <div>
                 <br>
                </div>
                <div>
                  The four Relationship Phases are sequenced one after the other, but a Person may switch from one to another in a non-sequenced way and may visit a phase multiple times during his life time. 
                </div>
                <div>
                 <br>
                </div>
                <div>
                  Relationship means mutual interaction and may require certain obligations and rules on both sides.
                </div>
                <div>
