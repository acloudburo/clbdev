# Overview

The Cloudburo App Platform is designed for cloud based web application serving micro businesses. The bootstrapping of this application platform is done during my spare time and allows me to exploit new technologies and frameworks.  
Due to the fact that I can only devote partial time in the design and development of the platform (beside my full time IT job at a Swiss Bank) it's an absolute necessity to document the work rigorously in order to take up development work efficiently after a longer break. 


> My experience is that a lot of tiny design and implementation decisions done during extensive programming sessions (e.g. during late night session) are fading away quite quickly out of the short term-memory and only a fuzzy image is surviving in some distant memory twists (well at least in my brain is acting in this). This results then unproductive sessions where I try to understand what I was assembling together some weeks ago. Anyway a good documentation will help in any case and will solidify the design and development foundation of the platform ;)  

_Be aware this is work in progress and will be evolutionary and incrementally extended._
